# odin-recipes

The Odin Recipes project is a simple website designed to showcase multiple recipes. The project begins with a basic homepage, index.html, and iterates through several stages to build recipe pages that contain images, descriptions, ingredients, and steps for each dish.

The purpose of this project is to practice creating static web pages using HTML. In the first iteration, you will create the basic structure of the site, starting with an index page. The second iteration will introduce individual recipe pages, with the ability to link between them for easy navigation. The third iteration expands the content by adding detailed recipe information, such as ingredients and steps. Finally, iteration four allows for adding more recipes and organizing them with links in a more structured format.
